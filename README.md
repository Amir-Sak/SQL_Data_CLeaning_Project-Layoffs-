# SQL_Data_CLeaning_Project-Layoffs-
This SQL project cleans data in the 'layoffs' table, removing duplicates, standardizing entries, handling null values, and removing unnecessary columns/rows, ensuring data integrity for analysis.
Data Cleaning (Continued):

After removing duplicates, I will standardize the data to ensure consistency and coherence.
This involves addressing issues such as null or blank values in the dataset and correcting any inconsistencies in column values.
Remove Duplicates:

I've identified duplicates in the dataset based on specific columns such as company, location, industry, total laid off, percentage laid off, date, stage, country, and funds raised.
I will delete duplicate entries to ensure the integrity of the data and avoid redundancy.
Standardize Data:

I will standardize column values, such as company names, by removing leading and trailing spaces or converting them to a consistent format.
Additionally, I'll update industry names for consistency and standardize country names.
Handle Null or Blank Values:

Next, I'll address null or blank values in the dataset. This involves identifying columns with missing values and deciding how to handle them.
For instance, I may replace null values with appropriate default values or delete rows with missing critical information, depending on the context.
Data Verification:

After cleaning and standardizing the data, I'll verify the changes to ensure accuracy and completeness.
This includes checking for any remaining inconsistencies or errors and validating the data against the original source or business requirements.
